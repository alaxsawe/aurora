### What is aurora?
Aurora is a lightweight social network application written in [Go programming language](http://golang.org/),
and using [bolt database](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) as its main storage source.

This is not for production use, I started this project as a way to learn more about the Go
programming language, and also to experiment with testing web services in Go.
